### Introduction 

I don't claim to be a web site designer at the graphic art level but I have 
occasionally constructed web sites and spash pages for clients and for myself.

Client work has been both from scratch and the redesign of existing sites.

### Boats Ibiza

Redesign of a legacy web site for the client, collating information scattered
across the legacy site, making it logically accessible  via collation and 
well-organised navigation.

A quick design of a web site to support marketing and sales for the
[electronic assessment system](/mark-it-quickly).
