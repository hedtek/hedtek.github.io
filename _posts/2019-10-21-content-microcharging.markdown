### What 

A micro-payment system that works across different sites 
and devices, enabling site users to make payments for  
for access to site content on a per page basis.

A Web and mobile solution was required that was exceptionally easy to use.


### Design criteria

UX design concentrated on several different aspects of the solution
* Extreme ease of use.
* A common Web and mobile solution that would be accessed and used in the same way
for payments and wallet top-up.
* Keeping the user informed as to what was happening at all stages, to 
remove any fear about payments getting out of hand.

Various small improvements complicated the design, for example:
* Particularly, small payments (up to a user definable limit) should be 
automatic.
* Use of a site should be free after a given total of payments is
reached in a single day.
* Re-visits to the same page should be free.
