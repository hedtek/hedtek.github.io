### Project description 

Product design for a micro-payment system that works across different sites 
and devices, enabling users to make payments for 
access to content on a per-page basis, regardless of the site being accessed.

### Design criteria

A Web and mobile solution was required that was extremely easy to use.

Design criteria also included:
* An almost non-existent learning curve.
* A common Web and mobile solution for payments and wallet top-up that would be 
 used in the same way regardless of what device was being used.
* Keeping the user informed as to what was happening at all stages; 
 this to remove any fear about payments getting out of hand and loss pre-paid funds.

Various small improvements complicated the design, for example:
* Small payments (up to a user definable limit) should be automatic.
* Users should be informed when making small payments.
* Use of a site should be free for a given period after a certain total of payments is
reached, progress to that total and the period of free use should be made clear.
* Re-visits to the same page should be free.
