### Project description 

Design of a SaaS product (including UX and UI design) for online tests and examinations for 
high school and university students. This provides for end-to-end testing from setting questions,
distribution, student answering, marking and mark analysis and distribution.

### Design criteria

Electronic assessment is a notoriously difficult area that is, for competitor products,
plagued by usability problems.

The major design criterion was:
* The primary design criterion was to produce a system with exceptional 
 ease-of-use for both teachers and students. 
 
In practice this meant:
* Ease in setting questions, where assessors tend to work on multiple aspects of the same
 test or examination at the same time. 
 This meant being able to being able to change the order, text of questions, marks 
 assigned to the questions, and even change question types (text to multiple choice, and vice versa)
 at any time in setting. Assessors needed 
* Almost everyone hates marking, and the the marking facilities need to be highly 
 interactive, exceptionally smooth, and allow for 
 easy review and modification of marks and feedback for students.
* \[TBA\]

The system needed to work in laptop/desktop browsers and in tablet browsers.

### Design process

Included \[still TBA\]:
* Market survey and competitor analysis, including sampling existing users
 as to desired system characteristics.
* Task-based descriptions of the assessment lifecycle and processes. 
* Construction of prototypes and evaluation with users and subject matter experts, 
 leading to redesign where needed, repeating this cycle.
* Evaluated use in production settings,
 leading to redesign where needed, repeating this cycle.
