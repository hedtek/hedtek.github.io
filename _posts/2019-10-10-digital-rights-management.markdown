### Product description 

Service design for a service for centralised / aggregated purchase of journal subscriptions (individually and in packages) 
by English Higher Education institutions, while
dealing with complex contractual and digital rights and licencing issues.

#### Motivation for a centralised service

The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), spends circa 
Â£25M per annum on 
print and electronic scholarly journal subscriptions for universities. 
Traditionally individual institutions had negotiated with publishers and journal-package
resellers individually. However HEFCE wished to centralised purchasing 
to drive down aggregate annual purchase costs and to introduce efficiencies
in purchasing mechanisms via common facilities.

The difficulties here were that individual university libraries used 
different purchasing processes with variant staffing, that there was
considerable complexity in digital rights for journals and journals sold
as packages, and in legal terms in contracts.

#### Outcomes

After implementation, the service is now in production use. 

While figures as to savings from centralised purchasing are not pubicly available, 
we believe them to be in the multi-million pound range.


### Design criteria

### Product

The product was a service design that was passed, in a waterfall fashion, to 
the implementors. This waterfall process was a result of how the larger project was organised
and not a personal choice.

Some design artefacts and one screenshot of the production service appear below.

### Service design process

I was part of a two person team that designed the service by:

* Generating user personas for purchasing and allied library staff.
* Gathering requirements gathering from subject matter experts in the UK and 
 authors of a similar system in the USA.
* Holding workshops with library staff from different services.
* Performing data modelling.
* Describing the variant 'As Is' purchasing processes.
* Designing service functionality and touchpoints.
* Designing service-based workflows.
* Constructing paper prototypes to use to validate the data models, touchpoints and workflows.
* Validating the design expressed in the paper prototypes (and further co-designing / modifying them) 
 with users from multiple libraries.

At the end of this process we handed off the service design to the service implementors.
