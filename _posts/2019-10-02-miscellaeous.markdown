### Augmented reality system

doop was an early augmented reality app for the iPhone. 

Conference attendees would use it 
to rate 
the quality of locations (pubs and bars) by scanning a QR code and entering a rating.
Attendees could then see locations, distances to the location and average ratings displayed on their iPhones as they scanned round
a neighbourhood. The system thus helped in making choices about where to relax and the direction
to go in to get there.
