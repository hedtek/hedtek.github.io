### Project descriptions 

A period of work on library systems resulted in 
* Improvements to the Copac union catalogue holding bibliographic records from multiple UK universities.
* A search engine that provided personalised results to searches for academic 
material, based on searcher academic characteristics and aggregated book loan histories from multiple universities.
* A report on future UX work for library systems, commissioned by SCONUL,
the UK library association.

### Product: Improvements to Copac

Two sets of recommendations were made:

Firstly, to address the volume of results for multiple editions and copies of works
across 136 libraries greater structuring of results was needed.
 
This relied on [FRBR](https://www.oclc.org/research/activities/frbr.html),
 a means of structuring individual books and editions into hierarchical 
 catalogue entries, enabling a user to drill down into the results hierarchy
 according to say, edition required or (local) holding library.

Sadly, Copac was not ready to undertake the data record processing needed to construct a full
FRBRised catalogue.

However, by way of example, a FRBR structured catalogue can be seen at 
[WorldCat](https://www.worldcat.org).

Secondly, my big win in improving Copac was simple, to bring Copac out of the 
dark ages by adding cover images to catalogue entries, 
thereby enlivening a very dry academic resource. In turn this induced cultural change
which motivated further UI design improvements.

While Copac is now deprecated, the same feature can be seen in its replacement.
