### Introduction 

A period of work on library systems resulted in 
* Improvements to the Copac union catalogue holding records across UK universities.
* A search engine that provided personalised results to searches for academic 
material, based on searcher characteristics and past loan histories.
* A report on future UX work for library systems, commissioned by SCONUL,
the UK library association.

### Improvements to Copac

Two sets of recommendations were made:
* To combat the volume of results for multiple copies of works in different editions
 etc. across 136 libraries. This relied on [FRBR](https://www.oclc.org/research/activities/frbr.html),
 a means of structuring individual books and editions into hierarchical 
 catalogue entries, enabling a user to drill down into the results 
 according to say, edition required, or (local) holding library. \[TBA screenshots
 from prototype.\] A FRBR structured catalogue can be seen [here](https://www.worldcat.org).
* The big win was simple, to bring Copac out of the dark ages by adding
 cover images to catalogue entries, thereby enlivening a very dry academic resource
 and encouraging further UI design improvements.
 . \[TBA screenshots from our prototype.\]
 While Copac is now deprecated, the same feature can be seen in its replacement.
