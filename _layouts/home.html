        Hedtek was a software house in the period July 2007 to Jul 2016.
    </p>
    <p>
        Besides straightforward commercial work for clients building, extending and running
        their systems, Hedtek was awarded more than Â£1M to perform applied research for
        various UK government-funded organisations.
    </p>

        Hedtek developed Gradient; an electronic assessment system for universities
        and high schools. Gradient primarily focuses on ease-of-use for students and
        assessors.
        Hedtek retains its interest in further exploitation of Gradient's
        patent-protected technology.

        Hedtek also provided technical and strategic consultancy services.

        Manchester based, Hedtek was closed as a software house in mid 2016 to enable a
        move from rain-drenched Manchester to sunnier climes in London.
    </p>
    <p>
        From that time, the company has served as a vehicle
        for contracting and consultancy activities,
        together with some open source development work.

        In a twist in geographic location, Hedtek's
        <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/markvanharmelen">principal</a>
        is now the CTO of a Manchester-based startup,
        <a href="https://prevayl.com">Prevayl</a>,
        albeit working in the new normal -- fully remotely.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hedtek remains a vehicle for various activities;
        currently CNC machine development for the commercial market.
